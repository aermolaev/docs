title: Node Map 
toc: false

The **Node Map** view visualizes the geographical configuration of a multi-regional cluster by plotting the node locations on a world map. The **Node Map** also provides real-time cluster metrics, with the ability to drill down to individual nodes to monitor and troubleshoot the cluster health and performance. 

<div id="toc"></div>

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}The <b>Node Map</b> is an <a href="enterprise-licensing.html">enterprise-only</a> feature. However, you can <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/request-a-license/">request a trial license</a>  to try out the <b>Node Map</b> view. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Why Use the Node Map View

The **Node Map View** helps you monitor the cluster health and performance, ensure effective resource utilization, and troubleshoot cluster issues:

### Monitor Cluster Health and Performance

The **Node Map** view provides:

- A high-level graphical overview of how the cluster is configured, which helps you understand how the available hardware is servicing your users. 
- Important cluster health metrics, such as Capacity and CPU utilization, QPS, and uptime.

### Ensure Effective Resource Utilization

The **Node Map** view helps you:

- Confirm that the database is balanced and you are utilizing the resource effectively. This helps you provision hardware and plan ahead for scale.
- Ensure that storage capacity is balanced across the disks available to the extent that they match the zone configs.
- Check if there resource congestion anywhere (for example certain nodes going beyond capacity).

### Troubleshoot the Cluster

The **Node Map** view helps you identify and preempt any scenarios that might cause downtime, service issues, or otherwise negatively impact cluster health. The **Node Map** view helps you:

- Monitor disk utilization to know if you need to add more storage capacity.
- Identify dead nodes in the cluster.
- Be informed about unavailable or under-replicated ranges.
- Confirm that configuration changes were persisted to the cluster.
- Observe QPS across nodes to ensure that queries are rerouted to live nodes if a node failure occurs.

## Configure and Navigate the Node Map

To configure the **Node Map**, you need to start the cluster with the correct `--localities` flags and assign the latitudes and longitudes for each region.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}The <b>Node Map</b> won't be displayed until all regions are assigned the corresponding latitudes and longitudes. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

Consider a four-node geo-distributed cluster with the following configuration:

|  Node | Region | Datacenter |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  N1 | us-east | us-east-1 |
|  N2 | us-east | us-east-1 |
|  N3 | us-west | us-west-1 |
|  N4 | eu-west | eu-west-1 |

#### Step 1. Ensure the CockroachDB version is 2.0 or higher

~~~ shell
$ ./cockroach version
~~~

If not, [upgrade to CockroachDB v2.0](upgrade-cockroach-version.html).

#### Step 2. Start the nodes with the correct `--localities` flags

In a new terminal, start Node 1:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
./cockroach start \
--insecure \
--locality=region=us-east,datacenter=us-east-1  \
--store=node1 \
--host=localhost \
--port=26257 \
--http-port=8080 \
--join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259
~~~

In a new terminal, start Node 2:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
./cockroach start \
--insecure \
--locality=region=us-east,datacenter=us-east-1 \
--store=node2 \
--host=localhost \
--port=26258 \
--http-port=8081 \
--join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259
~~~

In a new terminal, start Node 3:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
./cockroach start \
--insecure \
--locality=region=us-west,datacenter=us-west-1 \
--store=node3 \
--host=localhost \
--port=26259 \
--http-port=8082 \
--join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259
~~~

In a new terminal, start Node 4:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
./cockroach start \
--insecure \
--locality=region=eu-west,datacenter=eu-west-1 \
--store=node4 \
--host=localhost \
--port=26260 \
--http-port=8083 \
--join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259
~~~

In a new terminal, use the [`cockroach init`](initialize-a-cluster.html) command to perform a one-time initialization of the cluster:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
./cockroach init --insecure
~~~

#### Step 3. [Set the enterprise license](enterprise-licensing.html)

#### Step 4. Insert the latitudes and longitudes of each region into the `systems.locations` table

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO system.locations VALUES
  ('region', 'us-east', 40.367474, -82.996216), 
  ('region', 'us-west', 43.8041334, -120.55420119999997), 
  ('region', 'eu-west', 48.856614, 2.3522219000000177);
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}The <b>Node Map</b> won't be displayed until all regions are assigned the corresponding latitudes and longitudes. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

To get the latitudes and longitudes of AWS regions, see [Locations Co-ordinates for Reference](#location-co-ordinates-for-reference).

#### Step 5. Verify the settings 

Navigate to `https://localhost:8080/#/reports/localities` and use the **Localities** table to verify that the latitudes and longitudes correspond to the correct regions.

#### Step 6. View the Node Map

[Navigate to the **Overview page**](admin-ui-cluster-overview.html) and switch to the **Node Map** view from the drop-down box.

#### Step 7. Navigate the Node Map

Suppose you want to navigate to Node 2, which is in datacenter `us-east-1` in the region `us-east`. To navigate to Node 2:

1. Click on map component marked as **region=us-east** on the Node Map. The datacenter view is displayed.
2. Click on the datacenter component marked as **datacenter=us-east-1**. The individual node components are displayed.
3. To navigate back to the cluster view, either click on **Cluster** in the bread-crumb trail at the top of the Node Map, or click **Up to Cluster** in the lower left-hand side of the Node Map.
